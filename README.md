# Spotify Bad Shuffle
I don't think anyone will read this but if you want to run here should be the steps (I haven't actually tested this cause I built this for me so idk if it will work the same on other machines): <br>
1. Need Spotify Premium<br>
2. ```git clone```<br>
3. ```npm start``` then goto ```localhost:3000```<br>
4. Login and use

### p.s. There are still some bugs but I'll fix it if I can be bothered. <br>
### I'm mostly likely the only user so the bugs won't affect me much (It does what the end user wants and the end user doesn't encounter the bugs (me)).
